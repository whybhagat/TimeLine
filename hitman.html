          <div class="body">
            <p>Sharma was born on April 30, 1987, in Bansod, Nagpur, in the state of Maharashtra, India. He first joined a cricket camp in 1999, when coach Dinesh Lad, a friend of his uncle’s, noticed his talent. Lad used to scout for talent in those days and was very impressed with the way Sharma bowled. Knowing that Sharma’s uncle would not be able to afford the fees for the school where Lad was coach, Lad convinced the school’s director to accept Sharma as a student and waive his entire fee so that he would have access to good training facilities. Sharma started off as a spinner before focusing on batting.</p>

          <div class="body">
            <p>Sharma made his senior-level debut in a List A game in 2006, scoring an unbeaten 31 for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy. His run of scores in the tournament got him picked for the India A squad, and he made his first-class debut for India Athat team against New Zealand at Darwin later in 2006, scoring 57 and 22, respectively. India achieved a 3-wicket win over New Zealand. He subsequently made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai, one of the leading (and hard to break into) teams in the Indian domestic circuit, in the 2006–07 season and impressed with a double hundred while playing against Gujarat, as well as a half-century in a winning cause in the final that year. Sharma has gone on to represent Mumbai throughout his first-class career.</p>

          <div class="body">
            <p>Sharma joined the IPL in 2008 and was signed on by the now-defunct franchise Deccan Chargers, based in Hyderabad, for $750,000 a year. He was part of the Deccan Chargers that won the second edition of the IPL in 2009. He took a hat-trick against the Mumbai Indians that year with his part-time off-spin.</p>

          <div class="body">
            <p>In the 2011 IPL auction, Sharma joined the Mumbai Indians for $2 million and scored his first and only IPL century that year. He was appointed captain of the Mumbai Indians in 2013 and led them to five titles (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020). He also led them to the Champions League T20 title in 2013. Sharma captained the Mumbai Indians until December 2023 and has been retained by them in all auctions since 2011. He is noted for his calm demeanor and tactical acumen on the field.</p>

          <div class="body">
            <p>Sharma’s international career kicked off with an ODI match against Ireland at Belfast in June 2007, when he took one catch but did not get a chance to bat or bowl. His T20I debut was later the same year, in the group game against England in the first T20I World Cup. Again, he didn’t get a chance to bat or bowl but took one catch, in a match remembered for Yuvraj Singh’s six sixes in an over. Sharma was Player of the Match in the quarterfinals against South Africa. He was also part of the team that won the T20I World Cup final, scoring a quick 30, the second highest score for India.

              Sharma scored his first ODI half-century in November 2007</p>

            <p>He scored two ODI hundreds in 2010 but subsequently had a loss of form and fitness, which led to him being dropped from the eventually victorious 2011 ODI World Cup team. His loss of form continued for a couple of years, and he continued to be in and out of the team</p>

          <div class="body">
            <p>It was in 2013 that the captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, promoted Sharma as opener, a position at which he has been a success. His partnership with Shikhar Dhawan at the top of the order has yielded great results for India. He scored his first ODI double hundred against Australia the same year and followed it up with a second double hundred against Sri Lanka in 2014. The latter score of 264 remains an ODI record for highest individual score. Sharma made his Test debut in 2013, scoring 177 against West Indies in Kolkata, in Sachin Tendulkar’s farewell series. He was, however, unable to hold his position in the Test team for a few years after a run of poor scores in overseas Test matches.</p>

          <div class="title">2015</div>
          <div class="body">
            <p>In 2015 Sharma scored a T20I hundred against South Africa at Dharamshala, India, becoming the second Indian to score a hundred in all three international formats. In 2017 he scored a T20I hundred against Sri Lanka at Indore in only 35 balls, equaling David Miller’s record for the fastest T20I hundred. He was also part of the ODI World Cup team that year for the first time and scored one century as India made it to the semifinals.</p>

            <p>In 2017, when Virat Kohli, captain on the Indian ODI team at that time, was rested, Sharma was appointed captain of the ODI team in a series against Sri Lanka. He led India to victory and scored his third ODI double hundred.</p>

          <div class="body">
            <p>The 2019 ODI World Cup, where India made it to the semifinals, saw Sharma in a rich vein of form. He scored five centuries, the most in a single World Cup edition, and led the run charts. He was also vice captain during the tournament. The year also saw Sharma play the opening batsman role in Tests for the first time; he scored two hundreds in a match against South Africa.</p>

            <p>Sharma was appointed vice captain of the Test team during the 2020 series in Australia and scored critical runs in a series India won. He continued to score heavily in the 2021 twin series against England. In February 2022 he was appointed captain of the Indian team in all three formats.</p>

            <p>In the 2023 ODI World Cup, Sharma led the Indian team to a clean sweep in the league phase and, in the process, set a record for the most hundreds and the most sixes in ODI World Cup history. India went on to lose the final against Australia, after which Sharma took a break from limited-overs cricket.</p>
