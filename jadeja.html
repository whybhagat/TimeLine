          <div class="title">EARLY CARRIER</div>
          <div class="body">
            <p>Jadeja started playing cricket before he turned ten and he was way too involved. Small-time cricketer Mahendrasinh Chauhan used to instruct young children at a location called Cricket Bungalow. Jadeja entered it in some manner. He began his career as a fast bowler back then but Chauhan later ordered him to switch to left-arm spin. Over time Jadeja began to have an impact by participating in numerous age-level tournaments. On April 17 2016 Jadeja and Reeva Solanki got married. They have a daughter Nidhyana who was born in June 2017</p>

          <div class="body">
            <p>Jadeja was a member of Virat Kohli's team in 2008 which won the Under-19 World Cup. Later that year he joined Rajasthan Royals and made his IPL debut. He was hailed as a 'rockstar' by the team's captain and coach Shane Warne who was greatly impressed. Later on in the year against Orissa he scored 232* and added an unbroken 520 runs with Cheteshwar Pujara for the fifth wicket. He would add 539 with Sagar Jogiyani against Gujarat four seasons later. Up until that point only Frank Worrell had been a part of two 500-run partnerships.</p>

          <div class="body">
            <p>Jadeja was the first Indian to have three triple-hundreds as well. During that Gujarat match he scored 303*. A little over a month later he beat Railways with a score of 331. He defeated Orissa by 314 last year. Between all of this the Australians had savaged Jadeja in the 2009 World T20 knocking him out cold. He was hit for six consecutive sixes by Shane Watson off the final three balls of his first over and David Warner off the opening three balls of his second over</p>

          <div class="body">
            <p>Jadeja was made fun of on social media for a while because of those six balls. To 'troll' him they twisted jokes about Chuck Norris and Rajinikanth. Even MS Dhoni who served as both his captain for India and for Chennai Super Kings did not spare 'Sir Ravindra Jadeja.' But Jadeja persisted resurrecting his career in early 2013 â€” ironically against Australia. In that series he took 24 wickets at 17.45 including five wickets from Michael Clarke in three Tests. Four years later he would rout them once more this time with 25 wickets at 18.56.</p>
